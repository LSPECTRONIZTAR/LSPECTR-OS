Adrien's week couldn't get any worse. From near-trips orchestrated by his haters to delays in getting his PC back, topped with the unexpected demise of his beloved school iPad, life seemed to be playing a cruel joke on him. Forced to rely on a loaner device while awaiting a replacement, Adrien's patience was wearing thin.

In a bid to escape the frustrations of the present, Adrien hatches a daring plan for his 14th birthday—a family vacation powered by his latest invention, a groundbreaking, time-traveling device. His destination of choice? The summer of 2022, a year etched in his memory as a time of joy and freedom. He longs to roam carefree, to be able to read books gifted to his brother by his late cousin Patrick without his brother screaming at him about accidentally ripping them and "dishonoring his memory", treasures tinged with bittersweet memories. But his ambitions extend beyond mere nostalgia. Adrien dreams of reliving moments of triumph, like dominating his summer STEM program with unparalleled coding prowess. Yet, beneath his yearning for the past lies a deeper desire—to reconnect with Patrick, to bridge the gap left by a hospital's negligence on that fateful last day of 2022.

However, fate takes an unexpected turn as Omniscience, a notorious criminal mastermind, intervenes, intent on rewriting history. The universe's timeline shudders under the weight of Omniscience's meddling, setting the stage for a tumultuous journey filled with twists, challenges, and the unyielding quest for redemption.
