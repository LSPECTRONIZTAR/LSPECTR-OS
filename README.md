## THIS IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS SO DON'T ATTEMPT TO INSTALL IT LOL

LSPECTR-OS is an innovative executable application that brings a unique blend of entertainment and functionality to your Windows PC. It's important to note that LSPECTR-OS is not an actual operating system but rather a feature-rich application designed to enhance your digital experience.

## Features

- **Gaming Experience**: Play your favorite LSPECTROniverse games directly within LSPECTR-OS, eliminating the hassle of constantly switching between applications for convenience.
- **Multimedia Content**: Enjoy a variety of entertainment options, including YouTube videos and animations (specifically the ones created by [the developer](https://github.com/LSPECTRONIZTAR)).
- **Reading Material**: Dive into random stories and novels created by me out of pure boredom to relax and unwind.
- **Privacy Assurance**: LSPECTR-OS prioritizes your privacy and security. It does not share your personal information publicly, ensuring a safe and secure environment.

## Installation

To install LSPECTR-OS, simply download the executable file from our [Game Jolt page](insert_gamejolt_link_here) and follow the on-screen instructions.

## What LSPECTR-OS Can Do

- Provide a seamless gaming experience within the application.
- Offer a wide range of multimedia content, including YouTube videos and animations.
- Present engaging novels and random stories I made for your reading pleasure.

## What LSPECTR-OS Cannot Do

- Stick out its gyat(t) for the rizzler.

## Planned Features

- Voice chat (only that would require storing passwords into global Game Jolt data and I don't want to take risks)
